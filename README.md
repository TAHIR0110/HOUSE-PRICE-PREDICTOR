# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTOR

I've developed a straightforward website that assists users in estimating house prices based on their inputs regarding area, location, and the number of rooms.
To accomplish this, I've employed machine learning (ML) techniques.By utilizing tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib,
I've processed and analyzed over 1,000 instances of house price data. This information has enabled me to construct a predictive model.

For data exploration and model development, I utilized Jupyter Notebook, a versatile environment for data science tasks. 
This allowed me to seamlessly integrate the house price dataset and predict prices for new houses.
Additionally, I've taken advantage of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to create an engaging and user-friendly frontend for the website.
This frontend incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and appealing user experience.

In summary, I've combined machine learning methodologies, data preprocessing using libraries like pandas and numpy,visualization using matplotlib, 
and code execution in Jupyter Notebook.These efforts culminated in a website frontend developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
enhancing the user's ability to input data and receive accurate house price predictions.
